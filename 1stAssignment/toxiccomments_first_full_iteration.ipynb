OK, how 'bout this: the original comment I made about Everlast's entry constantly being vandalized by Eminem fans was written a month ago before your dumb ass got involved with the site. The feud started with the Dilated Peoples track. That's why I believed that the verse Everlast contributed should be in there (and still do). The jabs taken back and forth after that deserve a synopsis only. Your idiotic little comment about album sales was excessive and unnecessary. It belongs in there no more than the fact that everyone who knows both artists agrees that if they ever got into it, Everlast would knock the living shit outta Eminem. And THAT came off an Eminem fan site.\n",

GVnayR is a very \"\"dangerous\"\" Wikipedian, I can deepen it. I'm editing Wikipedia since 2010 and I can say that he is the lamest, weirdest, most \"\"dangerous\"\", etc. In my opinion being blocked indefinitely because of this is not fair (1~2 months is more fair). Sadly, blocking this user Hydao (who always fought against vandalism and addition of nonsense things) will not solve the problem. Sooner, the user GVnayR will start adding completely stupid and nonsense things on Wikipedia, which is unacceptable. I will continue fighting against vandalism and nonsense stuff (added by losers/nolifers like GVnayR), with or without \"\"Hydao\"\". Now you are thinking: \"\"Hydao, you are insulting a user by calling \"\"loser and no-lifer\"\", but that's not an insult, it's just the reality. A high-functioning autistic who doesn't work, doesn't have a job, doesn't have friends, use the government pension to buy PlayStation games and pay the Internet bill, someone who spend his days/months/years doing NOTHING useful (except making frequently STUPID edits on Wikipedia and wasting other ppl PRECIOUS time...) is a big loser who needs a LIFE LESSON. I don't mind if this \"\"Hydao\"\" is blocked, the only thing I know is that GVnayR needs an \"\"ULTIMATE LESSON\"\". Well, at least I can say that Hydao \"\"died\"\" or is \"\"dying\"\" for a decent/noble cause.   \"\n",

It is also accurate to say that area has no extent - just like a point or line. Area only begins to take on understandable dimensions once a point or line is assigned extent. As an example: If a line is made up of 3 points of zero extent, it's length is zero. If it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same, then the line has length of 3 units.

      "This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this. Thus, the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty, but rather a way to communicate.... you dolt\n",
