Yes, good to see that everybody has more or less agreed upon a non-descript colour format - fair enough (better than no colour formatting for headings). Jack Merridew - I see that you went and posted somewhere else that \"\"Miley Cyrus's fans can't have their own colour scheme\"\". Idiot, I had never even heard of this Miley Cyrus creature until I happened upon her page, and - to be quite frank - I don't think I would like her music if I were to hear it - I'm 55 years old. Nitwit. But you're a know-it-all, aren't you Jack? You know how I know that???

The Iranians. Do you know which country is the world's most educated Muslim country? Iran. So stop making us laugh and yes Iranians are Indo-Europeans like Russians, Armenians, and Greeks. Greeks are also the Iranians cousins and Iranians support the Greeks against Turkey. By the way the people you insulted were all Azeris and they want nothing to do with Turks.\n",

(See generally WP:SOCK) (But don't run around accusing everyone of being socks themselves, or you'll get yourself spanked for violating WP:POINT!!!).  I am not crazy about it, but I don't think it's nearly as offensive as calling someone a rapist, for example.  Even more confusingly, there isn't actually any rule against using socks, as long as you don't vote twice on the same issue or do one of a few other forbidden things.  My advice would be to blow the whole issue off  your comment counts as much as anyone else's, whether or not someone called you a sock.  Just explain that you're not a sock and go back to making your edits  what do you care what some other random editor sitting in his basement (like me) thinks?\n",

Evidence was produced by other users to show that he LIED when he said that he did just a simple copy-editing, as it was shown that he deleted sentences, and that he distorted the meaning of other phrases, simply because he has no clue about the Inclusive Democracy project.Despite all this, he comes back again and again adding/deleting and \"\"re-organizing\"\" at will this entry.

There you will find all sorts of uninformed, illogical, and downright dishonest claims about the UK legal system and the way the British press works.

If like me, you think this is contemptible, and want to challenge it - then you will just have complain to your congressman I guess, because it has become clear to me today at Wikipedia talk:In the news that the people at Wikipedia who make those sort of arguments, will absolutely, positively, not answer any questions at all about it - and others will apparently defend their rights to do so, by closing down such discussions. Apparently it's 'disruptive' to question the logic that goes into faulty Wikipedia decision making like this. As always, if you want to know what's going on the world, consult the other 'old media' outlets who, for all their faults, still make it their job to report on the news in a serious and credible manner.
